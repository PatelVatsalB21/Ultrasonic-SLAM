# Ultrasonic-SLAM
Ultrasonic slam is a library that can be used for navigation of IoT-based or automated devices especially low processing power devices. It consists of minimal hardware and works great for indoor navigation.

## Why is Ultrasonic-SLAM needed?
Generally, SLAM is used for mapping and navigation of the environment. It is used in smart home robots, indoor cleaning robots or security robots, etc. It can be used where the importance of current position and environmental awareness is critical. But the SLAM requires high processing power not offered by ESP and Arduino devices. Also, SLAM works with lasers. Since the basic range finding lasers or LIDARs starts with $100. So it is beneficial from the financial view, too, to use a single ultrasonic sensor with a price of around $1 for mapping with Ultrasonic SLAM.
